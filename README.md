 # TrastBallot - Decentralized Blockchain Based Voting System 
## About The Project

TrustBallot is a decentralized blockchain-based voting platform designed to ensure secure, anonymous, and tamper-proof elections. It leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent and trustworthy digital voting environment.
In traditional voting systems, concerns such as vote tampering, lack of transparency, and centralized control reduce public trust. TrustBallot addresses these challenges by using cryptographic hashing and a custom blockchain to guarantee immutable and verifiable election records.

### Why this project?
- Security: Protects votes using SHA-256 hashing and blockchain immutability.  
- Privacy: Ensures anonymous voting by separating voter identity from vote data.  
- Transparency: Provides real-time vote verification and a publicly verifiable ledger.  
- Fairness: Enforces a strict one-person-one-vote system.  
- Social Impact: Promotes digital democracy and builds trust in modern election systems using secure technology.
